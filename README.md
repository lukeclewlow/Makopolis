## Synopsis

Makopolis is a game to test coding knowledge. The dice is rolled, and the player can move forward on the board if they answer a coding question correctly. If the question is answered incorrectly, the player does not move. The player wins when they get to the finish line.

## Takeaway

I learnt more about how merge conflicts can be managed as we worked in a larger team.

This was the first time that I used Kanban on a project which really helped us to keep focused on bite sized tasks.
