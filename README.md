## Synopsis

Makopolis is a game to test coding knowledge. The dice is rolled, and the player can move forward on the board if they answer a coding question correctly. If the question is answered incorrectly, the player does not move. The player wins when they get to the finish line.

## Still to complete

- [ ] Some areas could benefit from refactoring.
- [ ] Make the game multi-player.

## Takeaway

I learnt more about how merge conflicts can be managed as we worked in a larger team.

This was the first time that I used Kanban on a project which really helped us to keep focused on bite sized tasks.

##How to run
`git clone git@github.com:sandagolcea/Makopolis.git`  
`npm install`  
`foreman start` or `node server.js`  
go to `localhost:5000`  

###To run tests:
```sh
npm install
grunt
```
For unit tests:   
`Open SpecRunner.html`


Objectives
-----
* Create an MVP in three days
* Test Driven Development
* Learning team skills
* Learn about planning and design


##technologies
* Javascript
* JQuery
* NODEjs, Express
* Html
* CSS
* Git
* Heroku
* Jasmine
* Casper, Mocha, Chai, Grunt
* WebSockets

MVP Requirements
---------------
- [x] Make a single player game with one character who goes on a coding journey from start to finish!
- [x] The character is animated
- [x] Questions appear on the page using JQuery

Enhancements
------------
If we had more time to work on this project, the features we would like to have added would be:
- [ ] Two player functionality using web sockets (multiplayer with sockets, turn implementation)
- [ ] The ability to ask questions that weren't multiple choice - real life coding problems
- [ ] A more responsive web page that isn't affected by resizing (improve css display (numbers could be attached to SVG elements))
- [ ] Timer for the questions (e.g.: 10 sec/question)
- [ ] Questions could be either from a github repo or transmitted in JSON format (hardcoded atm)
