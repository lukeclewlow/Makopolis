=============================================================

We built a coding based board game for our Makerthon Challenge, so that people might learn something about Ruby and have fun whilst doing it!

Heroku (live)
------
https://makopolis.herokuapp.com/

Objectives
-----
* Create an MVP in three days
* Test Driven Development
* Learning team skills
* Learn about planning and design

Technologies
----------
* Javascript
* JQuery
* Node
* Html
* CSS
* Git
* Heroku
* Jasmine
* Casper, Mocha, Chai
* WebSockets

MVP Requirements
---------------
- [x] Make a single player game with one character who goes on a coding journey from start to finish!
- [x] The character is animated
- [x] Questions appear on the page using JQuery

Enhancements
------------
If we had more time to work on this project, the features we would like to have added would be:
- [] Two player functionality using web sockets
- [] The ability to ask questions that weren't multiple choice - real life coding problems
- [] A more responsive web page that isn't affected by resizing
